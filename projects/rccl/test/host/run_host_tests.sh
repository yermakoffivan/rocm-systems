# Build and run the RCCL CPU-only host unit tests: rccl-HostUnitTests plus the
# host-only microtests (rccl-UnitTestsMicro, rccl-UnitTestsMicroInit[-uncached|-faultinj],
# rccl-UnitTestsMicroEnqueue[-devlinker]).
#
# Single source of truth for every command the host-test pipeline needs, so the
# same steps run locally and in CI and nothing is scattered in the workflow YAML.
# CI invokes each phase as its own step for clear failure attribution; locally,
# `all` runs the whole pipeline end to end.
#
# Usage:
#   run_host_tests.sh [deps|rccl-configure|hipify|configure|build|guards|run|coverage|all] [extra gtest args]
#   (default phase: all)
#
# Phases:
#   deps            install the host-test build/runtime dependencies via apt.
#                   CI runs this as its own step; not part of `all`.
#   rccl-configure  configure the RCCL tree (root) -- pins GPU_TARGETS so CMake
#                   never probes for a GPU; BUILD_TESTS=OFF (we only need hipify)
#   hipify          build the hipify_all target -> stages build/hipify/src, the
#                   prerequisite the host tests compile against
#   configure       configure test/host
#   build           build all host binaries (default target)
#   guards          device-table unittest and kernel-count pytest plus
#                   src/include/test_poison_hip_atomics.py
#   run             run the suite (timestamped log + JUnit XML). Always emits
#                   llvm source-based coverage profiles (*.profraw) into
#                   <BUILD_DIR>/coverage (requires the host tests to be built
#                   with -DHOST_TEST_COVERAGE=ON, the default). Also runs the
#                   checks in the `guards` phase above.
#   coverage        turn the per-binary *.profraw profiles from `run` into
#                   reports: a per-binary text/HTML report + lcov tracefile
#                   (clean, no hash mismatch), plus an overall line/branch union
#                   across all binaries via lcov (the CI metric).
