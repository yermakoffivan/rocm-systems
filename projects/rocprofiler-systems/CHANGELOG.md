# Changelog for ROCm Systems Profiler

Full documentation for ROCm Systems Profiler is available at [https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-systems/en/latest/](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-systems/en/latest/).

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.10.0 for ROCm 10.2 (unreleased)

### Added

- GPU-direct storage I/O telemetry. A background sampler reports per-GPU I/O
  counters (bytes, operation counts, errors, and bandwidth) in both Perfetto and RocPD
  output, with metrics selected by `ROCPROFSYS_HIPFILE_METRICS` and GPUs by
  `ROCPROFSYS_SAMPLING_GPUS`. Requires hipFile 0.5.0 or later. `ROCPROFSYS_USE_HIPFILE`
  is both the CMake option that compiles support in (`AUTO`/`ON`/`OFF`, default `AUTO`)
  and the run-time setting that enables collection (default `OFF`). See
  [hipFile GPU-direct storage I/O telemetry](./docs/how-to/hipfile-telemetry.rst).

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.9.0 for ROCm 10.1 (unreleased)

### Changed

- Minimum supported GCC raised from 10 to **GCC 11**, the first release with the
  C++20 support this project relies on. GCC 10 is no longer tested; configuring
  with an older GCC now emits a CMake warning. The RHEL 8 CI and release
  containers moved from `gcc-toolset-10` to `gcc-toolset-11`.
- `ROCPROFSYS_MONOCHROME` and `MONOCHROME` now treat any value other than a recognized
  false token (`off`/`false`/`no`/`n`/`f`/`0`) as `true`, instead of only recognizing a
  fixed set of true tokens.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.9.0 for ROCm 10.1

### Changed

- **rocpd is now the default output format.** When no output format is specified,
profiling data is emitted as a rocpd SQLite database (`rocpd.db`). Perfetto (`.proto`)
output must now be explicitly enabled via `--output-format proto`. Requires
ROCProfiler-SDK 1.0.0 or later (ROCm 7.0.0+).
- `ROCPROFSYS_PROFILE` (timemory backend) now defaults to `false`, since rocpd
replaces Perfetto as the primary trace output.
- All built-in presets that perform tracing (`--balanced`, `--detailed`, `--sys-trace`,
  `--runtime-trace`, `--trace-gpu`, `--trace-hpc`, `--trace-hw-counters`, `--trace-openmp`,
  `--workload-trace`) now produce a rocpd database by default, because rocpd is the new
  library default. The `--profile-only` and `--profile-mpi` presets explicitly disable
  rocpd output to preserve their lightweight, flat-profile-only character.
- `ROCPROFSYS_SAMPLING_GPUS` is now restricted by the GPUs the ROCm runtime exposes
  via `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` / `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
- The `trace-hpc` preset now enables flat profiling (`ROCPROFSYS_FLAT_PROFILE`) by
  default. Pass `--profile` to get a call-stack-based profile instead.
- `rocprof-sys-python` no longer accepts abbreviated long options (for example,
  `--conf` for `--config`). Spell out the full option name.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed `rocprof-sys-python` ignoring the `-c`/`--config` flag. The configuration
  file is now applied to `ROCPROFSYS_CONFIG_FILE` before the profiler bindings are
  loaded, so its settings take effect. A configuration file already named by
  `ROCPROFSYS_CONFIG_FILE` is preserved, and the one given on the command line is
  appended to it.

### Removed

- Removed the `ROCPROFSYS_BUILD_SQLITE3` CMake option and the in-tree SQLite3/rocpd
  storage backend. This is now handled by profiler-hub.

- Removed the deprecated `rocprof-sys-user` library and its C API
  (`rocprofsys_user_*`, `<rocprofiler-systems/user.h>`), including the `user`
  find_package component, the `examples/user-api` example, the Python
  `rocprofsys.user` submodule, and the associated pytest coverage. Use
  ROCTx (`rocprofiler-sdk-roctx`) for general-purpose manual instrumentation
  (starting/stopping tracing, named regions) instead; see `examples/roctx`
  for usage.

  - Causal profiling's `ROCPROFSYS_CAUSAL_PROGRESS`/`ROCPROFSYS_CAUSAL_BEGIN`/
    `ROCPROFSYS_CAUSAL_END` macros are unaffected at the source level: they now
    run on a new, minimal `rocprof-sys-causal-api` library instead of the removed
    general-purpose user API. Existing causal profiling code does not need to be
    edited, but it must be rebuilt against the new headers and library, and
    projects that requested the old component via
    `find_package(rocprofiler-systems COMPONENTS user)` must change that to
    `COMPONENTS causal-api`. The `user` component no longer exists, so requesting
    it now fails at configure time.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.8.0 for ROCm 10.0

### Added

- hipFILE (GPU-direct storage) API tracing. Add `hipfile_api` to
  `ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_DOMAINS` (shorthand: `hipfile`) to capture hipFILE API traces. Requires ROCProfiler-SDK version 1.3.5 or later.

- `--exe-only` flag for `rocprof-sys-instrument`: shorthand for excluding every shared
  library from instrumentation, leaving only the main executable.

- `--exclude-internal-lib-paths` flag for `rocprof-sys-instrument`: by default, each
  internal library is excluded only at the path linked at startup; when enabled, every
  on-disk path matching an internal library's filename is excluded.

- `--max-library-functions` option for `rocprof-sys-instrument`: skips shared libraries
  whose procedure count exceeds the given threshold, keeping instrumentation overhead
  manageable. The target executable is never gated by this, and the check is bypassed by
  the module include/restrict (`--module-include`/`-MI`, `--module-restrict`/`-MR`) and
  function include/restrict (`--function-include`/`-I`, `--function-restrict`/`-R`)
  regexes.

- rocSHMEM host-stream API tracing via `ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_DOMAINS=rocshmem_api`.
  ROCm Systems Profiler now captures the nine host-stream rocSHMEM API calls
  (`putmem_on_stream`, `getmem_on_stream`, `putmem_signal_on_stream`,
  `signal_wait_until_on_stream`, `broadcastmem_on_stream`, `alltoallmem_on_stream`,
  `barrier_all_on_stream`, `sync_all_on_stream`, `quiet_on_stream`) as
  `rocm_rocshmem_api` spans in Perfetto traces and rocpd databases. Requires
  rocprofiler-sdk >= 1.3.4 and rocSHMEM >= 3.6.0 (included in ROCm 10.0).
  As of rocSHMEM 3.6.0, `USE_ROCPROFILER_REGISTER` defaults to `ON`, so
  package installations automatically include this support. A `rocshmem` example
  demonstrating two-PE usage of all nine APIs is included under `examples/rocshmem`.

### Changed

- `ROCPROFSYS_BUILD_TESTING` no longer implies `ROCPROFSYS_BUILD_EXAMPLES`.

- Introduced the new `profiler-hub` writer backend for trace persistence, as a
  replacement for the existing SQLite3/rocpd backend.

### Removed

- Removed the `-p` / `--pid` option from `rocprof-sys-instrument` for attaching to
  an already running process. Use the `rocprof-sys-attach` executable instead, which
  attaches to and profiles running processes via the rocprofiler-sdk rocattach API.

- Removed `--parse-all-modules` from `rocprof-sys-instrument`. The tool iterates through objects and modules to extract the functions by default.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.7.0 for ROCm 7.14.0

### Added

- `--output-format` flag for `rocprof-sys-run` and `rocprof-sys-sample` to select
  output format(s) in a single, intuitive option: `proto` (Perfetto), `rocpd`
  (RocPD database), and `json` / `text` (Timemory profile; `txt` aliases `text`).
  Tokens are space- or comma-separated and authoritative — only the listed
  formats are produced. The existing `--trace`, `--profile`, `--flat-profile`,
  and `--profile-format` flags and their environment variables remain available,
  but cannot be combined with `--output-format` on the same command line.

- Unified-memory profiling reports (`unified_memory.txt` and
  `unified_memory.json`) summarizing KFD page fault and page migration events,
  including per-GPU counts, trigger breakdown (`gpu_page_fault`,
  `cpu_page_fault`, `prefetch`), and Host-to-Device/Device-to-Host migration
  bandwidth. Enable with `ROCPROFSYS_USE_UNIFIED_MEMORY_PROFILING=ON`; requires
  `HSA_XNACK=1` on an XNACK-capable AMD GPU and ROCm 7.13 or later. For standalone ROCprofiler-SDK installations, ROCProfiler-SDK 1.2.2 or later. The required KFD tracing domains are enabled automatically.

- Dedicated `ROCPROFSYS_UNIFIED_MEMORY_OUTPUT_PATH` setting for routing
  unified-memory profiling reports to an explicit output directory.

- MPI-rank-based console output filtering features controlled with CLI arguments:
  `--rank-filter-logs` and `--rank-filter-id`.

- GPU Hardware Performance Counter (PMC) sampling via the ROCprofiler-SDK device
  counting service. Periodic per-GPU hardware counters are collected alongside
  existing PMC sources and exposed in both Perfetto and RocPD outputs. Specify
  counters with `ROCPROFSYS_GPU_PERF_COUNTERS` (comma-separated; suffix
  `:device=N` to target a specific GPU). Requires ROCprofiler-SDK 0.6.0 or
  later (ROCm 6.4.0+).

- GPU graphics and memory clock frequency metrics (`gfx_clock`, `mem_clock`) via
  AMD SMI, exposing `current_gfxclk` and `current_uclk` in MHz as PMC samples.
  Configure via `ROCPROFSYS_AMD_SMI_METRICS=gfx_clock,mem_clock`.
- Progress bars during trace cache post-processing: perfetto generation
  (`sequential dispatch`) shows one bar per buffered_storage file in turn; rocpd
  generation (`multithreaded dispatch`) shows a single aggregate bar accumulating
  updates from all worker threads.
- Per-stream Perfetto tracks (`HIP Activity Stream {N}`) for kernel dispatch,
  scratch memory, and memory copy events in the trace-cache path, matching the
  buffered tracing behavior. Controlled via `ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_GROUP_BY_QUEUE`
  (default: `false` — group by HIP stream).
- Add `--list-domains` and `--list-operations <domain>` to `rocprof-sys-avail`.
  There new options allow the user to query more information about available
  ROCm domains (used in `ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_DOMAINS`) and their operations.
- Added `rocprofsys_push_trace_with_args`, a public API for pushing a user trace region
  with a pre-serialized argument string attached. The arguments are recorded in cached
  tracing mode (the default); in legacy tracing (`ROCPROFSYS_TRACE_CACHED=OFF`) they are
  ignored.

### Changed

- Split PMC AMD SMI, ROCprofiler-SDK, and procfs wrappers into standalone
  internal backend targets under `source/lib/backends`, replacing the old
  PMC `drivers` layout.
- Remove Boost as a Dyninst dependency by replacing Boost usage with in-tree
  `dyncompat` shims and C++17 standard library equivalents; Bundled Dyninst now
  requires **GCC ≥ 10**.
- The `trace-openmp` configuration preset no longer includes `HSA_API`,
  by default.
- `rocprof-sys-sample` - Aligned flags with `rocprof-sys-run`. Renamed `--freq`,
  `--cputime` and `--realtime` to `--sampling-freq`, `--sampling-cputime` and
  `--sampling-realtime`, respectively. Old flags are still handled as a part of
  backward compatibility.
- Allow presets to use `--gpus`/`--cpu`/`--ai-nics` flags without
  `--device`/`--host` flags.
- Minimum required C++ standard raised from C++17 to C++20. timemory now builds
  against the `rocprofiler-systems-cppstd20` branch and spdlog was bumped to
  v1.17.0 (bundled fmt v12).
- Supported environment variables for rank detection: removed MPI_RANK and
  MPI_LOCALRANKID, added PMI_RANK and SLURM_PROCID.

### Resolved issues

- Fix ElfUtils build on GCC 15.
- Fix output directory of `rocpd` files when re-attaching to the same process
  with `rocprof-sys-attach`. Now, each session will have a unique output folder.
- Fix CPU related counters (like CPU frequency) missing from `rocpd` output.
- Fixed the handling of "group-by-queue" option in the Perfetto generator.
- Fix visualization of GPU counters, which made it look like there was activity
  between kernel dispatches.
- Fixed hang due to mismatched versions of `binutils` between system and bundled
  versions. Ensure that the vendored version of `binutils`'s symbols are hidden.
- Fix for ASAN build on TheRock.
- Fix issue that could cause certain events to appear in trace, when the should
  have been excluded due to roctx region filtering.
- Fix cmake issue that caused the wrong version of `elfutils` to be linked when
  building for TheRock. The system version of `elfutils` was used, rather than
  the vendored version causing package install failures.
- Fix documentation and internal config handling that referenced the non-existent
  `ROCPROFSYS_USE_TRACE`. The Perfetto tracing backend is controlled by
  `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE`; setting `ROCPROFSYS_USE_TRACE` had no effect.
- Fixed a pre-main `rocprof-sys-run` `SIGSEGV` in `rocprofiler_configure()` when
  profiling OpenMPI GPU-aware MPI workloads.

### Known issues

- A push/pop trace count imbalance can occur for workloads that instrument runtime
  internals such as OMPT. When pushes exceed pops, rocprof-sys completes
  finalization, emits a warning, and omits any still-open trace regions from the
  generated trace output.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.6.0 for ROCm 7.13.0

### Added

- Kernel Fusion Driver (KFD) event tracing support to capture page faults, page
  migrations, queue evictions, GPU unmap events, and dropped events. Requires
  ROCprofiler-SDK 1.2.2 or later. Enable with
  `ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_DOMAINS=kfd_events`.
- Support for pause and resume of profiling via `roctxProfilerPause` and
  `roctxProfilerResume`.
- Support for selective region tracing via the `ROCPROFSYS_SELECTED_REGIONS`
  environment variable, limiting tracing to specified regions.
- `--selected-regions` CLI argument to `rocprof-sys-sample`, `rocprof-sys-run`,
  and `rocprof-sys-instrument` for specifying selective region tracing from the
  command line.
- Support for re-attaching to a previously profiled process. After detaching,
  `rocprof-sys-attach` can re-attach to the same PID for a new profiling session.
- MPI-rank-based file output filtering features controlled with new CLI arguments:
  `--rank-filter-output` and `--rank-filter-id`.
- JSON-based configurable preset system with `--preset=<name>` flag, replacing the
  old `--<preset-name>` flags. Presets are now loaded from JSON files in
  `source/bin/common/presets/`, making them extensible and exportable. Use
  `--list-presets` to see available presets and `--explain=<name>` for detailed
  preset information.
- Domain flags for composable configuration: `--gpu[=metrics]`, `--rocm[=domains]`,
`--cpu[=hz]`, `--parallel[=runtimes]`. Domain flags can be combined with presets
  to customize profiling without editing configuration files.
- Configuration export via `--export-config[=file]` to save resolved settings as
  reusable JSON configuration files. Exported configs can be loaded back with
  `--preset=./config.json`.
- Topic-based help system: `--help` now shows a compact summary with essential
  options and a list of help topics. Use `--help=<topic>` (e.g., `--help=sampling`,
  `--help=gpu`, `--help=tracing`) to see only relevant options. Use `--help=all`
  for the full option listing.
- Post-run output summary during library finalization showing result file locations.
- JSON schema file (`share/rocprofiler-systems/presets/schema.json`) for preset
  validation.
- Documentation (`docs/how-to/instrumenting-rewriting-binary-application.rst`)
  describing what to do when Dyninst reports a "Failed to transform trace" error
  during instrumentation.

### Changed

- `rocprof-sys-avail` no longer queries GPU devices or hardware counters unless
  `--hw-counters` or `--all` is requested, reducing startup time and allowing
  settings/component queries in environments without GPU/ROCm.
- `rocprof-sys-instrument` diagnostic file dumps (available, instrumented,
  excluded, coverage, overlapping) are now gated behind the `--dump-info` flag
  instead of being generated unconditionally.
- Preset flags changed from `--balanced` to `--preset=balanced` syntax. The old
  `--<preset-name>` flags are still supported and handled within `preset_registry`.
- Removed the `ROCPROFSYS_USE_ROCM` CMake option. ROCm is now required for
  building the ROCm Systems Profiler.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed an issue where the `--rocm-domains` CLI option for `rocprof-sys-run` was not recognized.
- Fixed invalid strongly typed configuration values for `ROCPROFSYS_MODE`,
  `ROCPROFSYS_PERFETTO_BACKEND`, `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE`,
  `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE_DURATION`, and `ROCPROFSYS_SAMPLING_FREQ` being silently
  accepted or failing later during runtime instead of reporting clear
  configuration diagnostics.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.5.0 for ROCm 7.12.0

### Added

- Per-GPU RCCL communication data counters (Send/Recv) in `rocpd` output with multi-GPU device attribution using `ncclCommCuDevice` API.
- Presets profiles that configure the rocprofiler-system tools for common profiling scenarios, offering optimized configurations for specific use cases.
- SDMA (System Direct Memory Access) utilization metrics support via AMD SMI, showing device-level SDMA usage percentage aggregated from all processes. Configure via `ROCPROFSYS_AMD_SMI_METRICS=sdma_usage`.
- `rocprof-sys-attach` CLI tool for attaching to and profiling running processes via ROCprofiler-SDK rocattach API (experimental).
- Support for OpenSHMEM API tracing via `ROCPROFSYS_USE_OPENSHMEM=ON` configuration setting.

### Changed

- Simplify categorizing like pmc_info events by removing the "_<idx>" from the "symbol" field. ie., "JpegAct_0" -> "JpegAct".
- Added `libhsa-runtime64.so` and `libomp.so` to the internal library exclusion list for runtime instrumentation to prevent instrumenting of runtime library internals.
- RCCL implementation refactored with `production_pmc_registrar` for improved testability and separation of concerns.
- Unsupported RCCL datatypes now gracefully return 0 with `LOG_WARNING` instead of aborting profiler, allowing continued profiling with newer RCCL versions.
- Added AI NIC support.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed an issue where JPEG engine activity PMC events were not being collected for MI35X systems. Only the first 32 JPEG engines were being collected.
- Fixed MPI perfetto trace file merging when using trace cache mode with `ROCPROFSYS_PERFETTO_COMBINE_TRACES=ON`.
  Previously, each MPI rank would produce a separate trace file; now all ranks' traces are correctly merged into a single output file.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.4.0 for ROCm 7.11.0

### Added

- Support for UCX (Unified Communication X) API tracing.
- Profiling and metric collection capabilities for XGMI and PCIe data.
- How-to document for XGMI and PCIe sampling and monitoring.
- Documentation for `--trace-legacy` / `-L` CLI flag for direct tracing mode.
- Added dependency to `spdlog` library.
- Added environment variable `ROCPROFSYS_LOG_LEVEL` which control level of logging.
  - Available log levels: `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `info`(default), `debug`, `trace` and `off`.
- Added cmake option `ROCPROFSYS_GFX_TARGETS` which controls GFX targets used to build example binaries.

### Changed

- `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE` now controls whether perfetto tracing is enabled (default: true when tracing mode).
- `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE_LEGACY` controls whether to use legacy direct mode (true) or cached mode (false, default).
- By default, tracing uses deferred trace generation (cached mode) for improved performance and minimal runtime overhead.
- `--trace` / `-T` CLI flag enables tracing with cached mode by default.
- `--trace-legacy` / `-L` CLI flag enables legacy direct mode for tracing.
- Changed thread storage allocation from a hard-coded 4096-element array to a compile-time computed size derived from the ROCPROFSYS_MAX_THREADS configuration flag.
- Changed logging module to use `spdlog` library.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed application termination with segfault when thread creation surpasses ROCPROFSYS_MAX_THREADS configuration.
- Fixed how `roctxRange` markers are handled in the `rocpd` output. The "push" and "pop" markers are now shown as a single event.

### Removed

- `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE_CACHED` environment variable (tracing now uses cached mode by default when `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE_LEGACY=false`).

### Deprecated

- `ROCPROFSYS_USE_PERFETTO` environment variable (use `ROCPROFSYS_TRACE`).
- `ROCPROFSYS_VERBOSE` and `ROCPROFSYS_DEBUG` environment variables (use `ROCPROFSYS_LOG_LEVEL`).

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.3.0 for ROCm 7.2.0

### Added

- Added a `ROCPROFSYS_PERFETTO_FLUSH_PERIOD_MS` configuration setting to set the flush period for Perfetto traces. The default value is 10000 ms (10 seconds).
- Added fetching of the `rocpd` schema from rocprofiler-sdk-rocpd

### Changed

- Improved Fortran main function detection to ensure `rocprof-sys-instrument` uses the Fortran program main function instead of the C wrapper.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed a crash when running `rocprof-sys-python` with ROCPROFSYS_USE_ROCPD enabled.
- Fixed an issue where kernel/memory-copy events could appear on the wrong Perfetto track (e.g., queue track when stream grouping was requested) because _group_by_queue state leaked between records.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.2.1 for ROCm 7.1.1

### Resolved issues

- Fixed an issue of OpenMP Tools (OMPT) events, GPU performance counters, VA-API, MPI, and host events failing to be collected in the `rocpd` output.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.2.0 for ROCm 7.1.0

### Added

- ``ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_GROUP_BY_QUEUE`` configuration setting to allow grouping of events by hardware queue, instead of the default grouping.
- Support for `rocpd` database output with the `ROCPROFSYS_USE_ROCPD` configuration setting.
- Support for profiling PyTorch workloads using the `rocpd` output database.
- Support for tracing OpenMP API in Fortran applications.
- An error warning that is triggered if the profiler application fails due to SELinux enforcement being enabled. The warning includes steps to disable SELinux enforcement.

### Changed

- Updated the grouping of "kernel dispatch" and "memory copy" events in Perfetto traces. They are now grouped together by HIP Stream rather than separately and by hardware queue.
- Updated PAPI module to v7.2.0b2.
- ROCprofiler-SDK is now used for tracing OMPT API calls.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.1.1 for ROCm 7.0.2

### Resolved issues

- Fixed an issue where ROC-TX ranges were displayed as two separate events instead of a single spanning event.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.1.0 for ROCm 7.0

### Added

- Profiling and metric collection capabilities for VCN engine activity, JPEG engine activity, and API tracing for rocDecode, rocJPEG, and VA-APIs.
- How-to document for VCN and JPEG activity sampling and tracing.
- Support for tracing Fortran applications.
- Support for tracing MPI API in Fortran.

### Changed

- Replaced ROCm SMI backend with AMD SMI backend for collecting GPU metrics.
- ROCprofiler-SDK is now used to trace RCCL API and collect communication counters.
  - Use the setting `ROCPROFSYS_USE_RCCLP = ON` to enable profiling and tracing of RCCL application data.
- Updated the Dyninst submodule to v13.0.
- Set the default value of `ROCPROFSYS_SAMPLING_CPUS` to `none`.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed GPU metric collection settings with `ROCPROFSYS_AMD_SMI_METRICS`.
- Fixed a build issue with CMake 4.
- Fixed incorrect kernel names shown for kernel dispatch tracks in Perfetto.
- Fixed formatting of some output logs.
- Fixed an issue where ROC-TX ranges were displayed as two separate events instead of a single spanning event.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.0.2 for ROCm 6.4.2

### Optimized

- Improved readability of the OpenMP target offload traces by showing on a single Perfetto track.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed the file path to the script that merges Perfetto files from multi-process MPI runs. The script has also been renamed from `merge-multiprocess-output.sh` to `rocprof-sys-merge-output.sh`.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.0.1 for ROCm 6.4.1

### Added

- How-to document for [network performance profiling](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-systems/en/amd-staging/how-to/nic-profiling.html) for standard Network Interface Cards (NICs).

### Resolved issues

- Fixed a build issue with Dyninst on GCC 13.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 1.0.0 for ROCm 6.4.0

### Added

- Support for VA-API and rocDecode tracing.

- Aggregation of MPI data collected across distributed nodes and ranks. The data is concatenated into a single proto file.

### Changed

- Backend refactored to use ROCprofiler-SDK rather than ROCProfiler and ROCTracer.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed hardware counter summary files not being generated after profiling.

- Fixed an application crash when collecting performance counters with ROCProfiler.

- Fixed interruption in config file generation.

- Fixed segmentation fault while running `rocprof-sys-instrument`.

- Fixed an issue where running `rocprof-sys-causal` or using the `-I all` option with `rocprof-sys-sample` caused the system to become non-responsive.

- Fixed an issue where sampling multi-GPU Python workloads caused the system to stop responding.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 0.1.1 for ROCm 6.3.2

### Resolved issues

- Fixed an error when building from source on some SUSE and RHEL systems when using the `ROCPROFSYS_BUILD_DYNINST` option.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 0.1.0 for ROCm 6.3.1

### Added

- Improvements to support OMPT target offload.

### Resolved issues

- Fixed an issue with generated Perfetto files.

- Fixed an issue with merging multiple `.proto` files.

- Fixed an issue causing GPU resource data to be missing from traces of Instinct MI300A systems.

- Fixed a minor issue for users upgrading to ROCm 6.3 from 6.2 post-rename from `omnitrace`.

## ROCm Systems Profiler 0.1.0 for ROCm 6.3.0

### Changed

- Renamed Omnitrace to ROCm Systems Profiler.

## Omnitrace 1.11.2 for ROCm 6.2.1

### Known issues

- Perfetto can no longer open Omnitrace proto files. Loading the Perfetto trace output `.proto` file in `ui.perfetto.dev` can
  result in a dialog with the message, "Oops, something went wrong! Please file a bug." The information in the dialog will
  refer to an "Unknown field type." The workaround is to open the files with the previous version of the Perfetto UI found
  at <https://ui.perfetto.dev/v46.0-35b3d9845/#!/>.
