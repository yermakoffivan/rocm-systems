"""Compute the build-stage allowlist for a rocm-systems PR.

This is the rocm-systems half of per-PR selective builds. It maps the changed
projects to the minimal set of TheRock build stages needed to build them and
emits that set as ``build_stages`` -- an *allowlist* consumed by TheRock's
``setup_multi_arch.yml`` (added in ROCm/TheRock#7600). Every stage outside the
allowlist is skipped by TheRock outright: no build, no artifact copy. An empty
allowlist means "build every stage" (the safe default).

Why an allowlist (not a skip list): callers declare the stages they *want*, so
adding a new stage to BUILD_TOPOLOGY.toml never silently widens a narrow PR's
scope -- the new stage is simply not requested. TheRock computes the skip
complement and validates the names on its side.

Stage selection is delegated to TheRock's build topology (the single source of
truth), imported from the TheRock checkout so this script owns no dependency
math and cannot drift from the actual build graph:

    BuildTopology.resolve_alias_to_artifact(project)  # project -> artifact
    BuildTopology.get_stages_for_artifacts(artifacts)
        -> the minimal set of stages needed to BUILD the changed projects
           (impacted stages plus their upstream build dependencies).

Fail-safe: whenever the change set cannot be confidently narrowed, this prints
an empty ``build_stages`` so TheRock builds everything. That happens for: a
run_all_tests (CI-infra) change, no changed projects, a full-build project (see
FULL_BUILD_PROJECTS), an unknown/unmapped project, or any topology-load error.

Usage:
    python compute_build_stages.py \
        --changed-projects "projects/rdc,projects/rocdecode" \
        --run-all-tests false \
        --therock-path _therock

Output (to $GITHUB_OUTPUT), written as ``build_stages=<value>``:
    a comma-separated allowlist of stages to build (empty string = build all)
